# Practical Digital Signal Processing in C

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of key algorithms used in digital signal processing (DSP) using the C programming language. I follow a course which covers fundamental and advanced DSP techniques.

## What you will find in this repository ?

I am able to:

Develop the Convolution Kernel algorithm in C.

Implement the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) algorithms in C.

Design and develop Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters in C.

Implement Windowed-Sinc filters in C.

Construct Modified Sallen-Key filters.

Design and build Bessel, Chebyshev, and Butterworth filters.

Develop the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in C.
